CS50x Problem Set 6: Readability  ðŸŒŸ
=======================================

Overview
--------

This is my solution for the CS50x Problem Set 6 - Readability. The program, `readability.py`, computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend a given text using the Coleman-Liau formula. The user is prompted to enter the text, and the program outputs the corresponding grade level.

Example Output
--------------


```bash

$ python readability.py
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
```

Implementation
--------------

### Prompt for Text

-   Utilizes `get_string` to prompt the user for input text.

### Compute Coleman-Liau Index

-   Calculates the average number of letters, words, and sentences per 100 words in the text.
-   Applies the Coleman-Liau formula: `0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8`.
-   Rounds the result to the nearest integer.

### Output Grade Level

-   Prints the computed grade level rounded to the nearest integer.
-   Handles special cases such as "Grade 16+" and "Before Grade 1" according to specified conditions.

Usage
-----

Execute the program by running the following command:

bashCopy code

`$ python readability.py`

Follow the prompts to enter the desired text, and the program will output the corresponding grade level.

Testing
-------

While check50 is available for this problem, you're encouraged to first test your code on your own using the provided test cases.
