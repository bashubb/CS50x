CS50x Lab 4: My Smiley Image Manipulation Journey üé®
====================================================

Cheers to conquering Lab 4 in the CS50x course! This hands-on adventure led me through the exciting realm of image manipulation, focusing on the manipulation of BMP files to infuse a burst of color into the iconic smiley face. 

My Learning Goals üöÄ
--------------------

Throughout this lab, I dove into the intricacies of image storage, honing my skills in pixel manipulation. The primary goals included comprehending the representation of images through RGB values and mastering the art of tweaking pixels.

Background: The Smiley Face BMP 
----------------------------------

The image I worked with introduced the concept of 24 bits per pixel, allowing for a richer representation of colors. Each pixel comprised eight bits for red, eight for green, and eight for blue, resulting in a vibrant spectrum of colors. The RGB triple struct in bmp.h encapsulated this information, using three bytes for color representation.

My Implementation: Colorize Function üé®
---------------------------------------

My mission in the `helpers.c` file was to tackle the colorize function. Given the image's dimensions and an array of RGB triples, I seamlessly replaced all black pixels with a color of my choosing. My expertise in pixel manipulation brought life and vibrancy to the once monochromatic smiley face, showcasing my coding prowess.

My Code Exploration üîç
----------------------

As I navigated through the helper files, dealing with image file I/O and metadata, I gained valuable insights into the structure of BMP files. Understanding how RGB triples were organized in bmp.h laid the foundation for my successful pixel manipulations. This exploration bridged the theoretical concepts with practical implementations.

Conclusion üéâ
-------------

Completing Lab 4 marks my proficiency in fundamental image processing techniques. Experimenting with different color choices and witnessing the transformation of pixels, I showcased my mastery over the canvas. My coding journey continues, and the world of image manipulation is now at my fingertips! Happy coding! üñåÔ∏è
