Reflections on Spotify Wrapped
------------------------------

### Audio Aura Calculation ðŸŒŸ

Spotify Wrapped often characterizes a listener's "Audio Aura" based on the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top songs. It's fascinating how these musical attributes contribute to a unique auditory experience for each listener.

### My Thoughts and Proposals ðŸ¤”

In `answers.txt`, I've shared my reflections on the audio aura calculation. I've also proposed potential improvements, considering factors like song attribute distribution and dynamic shifts in musical preferences.

Feel free to explore the SQL queries and insights provided in the files. ðŸŽ¶
