                <p class="card-text">Welcome to the introductory page about how the internet works. Here, we'll cover the basics and provide an overview of the key concepts.</p>
                <p>
                    The introduction to the internet marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of communication and information exchange. The internet, often referred to as the "world wide web," is a vast network connecting millions of devices worldwide. Its inception can be traced back to the late 20th century, with the development of protocols and technologies that laid the groundwork for seamless global connectivity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At its core, the internet is a decentralized system, allowing devices such as computers, smartphones, and servers to communicate with each other without a central governing authority. This decentralized nature contributes to its resilience and adaptability. The internet operates on a set of protocols, most notably the Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which define how data is transmitted and received across the network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the key features of the internet is its ability to transcend geographical boundaries, connecting people, businesses, and organizations across the globe. This connectivity has transformed the way we access information, communicate, and conduct business. The internet has become an indispensable tool for research, education, entertainment, and commerce.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Web browsers serve as gateways to the internet, allowing users to navigate through websites, each identified by a unique domain name. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, facilitating user-friendly navigation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The internet's impact on society is profound, fostering the democratization of information and enabling collaboration on a global scale. Social media platforms, online forums, and collaborative tools have become integral parts of the internet experience, facilitating communication and interaction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As technology continues to advance, the internet evolves with it. The advent of high-speed broadband, mobile connectivity, and the Internet of Things (IoT) further expands the capabilities of this interconnected network. However, the rise of the internet also raises important considerations regarding privacy, security, and digital literacy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, the introduction to the internet represents a transformative moment in human history, reshaping the way we live, work, and connect. Its continued evolution promises new possibilities and challenges, emphasizing the need for responsible use and thoughtful navigation of the digital landscape.
