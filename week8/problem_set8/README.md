Lab 8: Homepage Showcase 🌐
=============================

Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to my Lab 8 journey, where I've ventured into creating a simple homepage. Let's explore the process and the intriguing features I've added.

Homepage Unveiling 
---------------------

### Getting Started

I kicked off by logging into cs50.dev, navigating to the `homepage` directory, and grabbing the essential files - `index.html` and `styles.css`.

### Implementation Highlights

Here's a breakdown of the key elements integrated into my homepage:

#### Part 1 - Multiple Pages

I've designed at least four different HTML pages, ensuring seamless navigation with hyperlinks. The central hub is the `index.html` page.

#### Part 2 - HTML Variety

To meet the requirement of ten distinct HTML tags, I creatively utilized a mix of tags, maintaining diversity in the structure of my pages.

#### Part 3 - Bootstrap Integration

Leveraging the power of Bootstrap, I enhanced the visual appeal of my site. Components like navigation bars and grids added a professional touch.

#### Part 4 - Custom Styling

In `styles.css`, I crafted unique styles using over five different CSS selectors and properties. This injected personality and life into my homepage.

#### Part 5 - JavaScript Interaction

To elevate user interaction, I incorporated JavaScript features. Dynamic alerts and periodic effects enhance the overall user experience.
