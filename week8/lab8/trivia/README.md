CS50x Lab 8: Trivia 
============================

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I've embarked on the Lab 8 journey, diving into the world of trivia. Let me walk you through the exciting task and the creative implementation I've crafted.

Trivia Webpage Unleashed ðŸš€
---------------------------

### Getting Started

I've started by opening VS Code, navigating to the `trivia` directory, and downloading the necessary files. The `index.html` and `styles.css` files are the key players in this trivia adventure.

### Implementation Details

#### Part 1 - Multiple-Choice Question

I've added an engaging multiple-choice trivia question using HTML. The question is presented with an h3 heading, and users can select from various answer choices. Here's what I've done:

-   Used an h3 heading for the question.
-   Provided multiple answer choices with buttons.
-   Ensured there is one correct answer among the options.

#### Part 2 - Free Response Question

I've also added an intriguing text-based free-response question with HTML. The question is presented with an h3 heading, and users can type their responses in an input field. Here's the breakdown:

-   Used an h3 heading for the question.
-   Incorporated an input field for user responses.
-   Added a button for users to confirm their answers.

### JavaScript Magic âœ¨

The JavaScript magic comes into play as users interact with the trivia questions:

-   **Button Clicks for Multiple-Choice:**

    -   Buttons change colors on click.
    -   Incorrect answer turns the button red, accompanied by an "Incorrect" message.
    -   Correct answer turns the button green, accompanied by a "Correct!" message.
-   **Confirmation for Free Response:**

    -   Input field changes color upon confirmation.
    -   Incorrect answer turns the input field red, with an "Incorrect" message.
    -   Correct answer turns the input field green, with a "Correct!" message.

### Example Output ðŸŒŸ
