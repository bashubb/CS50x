CS50x Problem Set 5: Speller
============================

Hey there! 🚀 Excited to share my CS50x Speller solution with you. Let's break it down!

CS50x Problem Set 5: Speller
----------------------------

Welcome to the world of spell-checking! 📚✨ In this project, I've crafted a spell checker using a hash table to ensure every word in a given text is correctly spelled.

Ready to explore my CS50x Speller solution? Let's dive in!

Behind the Scenes
-----------------

-   **The Components:**

    -   `dictionary.c`: The spell-checker's core logic.
    -   `dictionary.h`: The rulebook.
    -   `speller.c`: The conductor coordinating everything.
    -   `Makefile`: The tool for building the spell-checker.
-   **Optimizations:**

    -   Custom hash functions for speedy searches.
    -   Smart memory usage for better performance.
    -   Case-insensitivity for accurate spell-checking.

Benchmarking
------------

-   See the magic stats:
    -   Load time ⏱️
    -   Check time 🔍
    -   Size time 📏
    -   Unload time 🔄
    -   Total time ⏰

Customization
-------------

-   Modify the code for your dictionaries and texts.
-   Adjust N in `dictionary.c` for a customized hash table.

What's Off-Limits?
------------------

-   Hands off `speller.c` and `Makefile`.
-   Feel free to tweak `dictionary.c`, but keep the prototypes intact.

Testing
-------

-   Rigorously tested on texts from La La Land and more for accuracy.
-   Used `diff` for thorough spell-checking.

Let the Magic Begin
-------------------

Dive into the code, run it on your texts, and let's discuss the magic it brings! Your thoughts mean a lot! Enjoy spell-checking like never before! 😄🎉
