# Scratch Project

Hey there, it's time to dive into the world of Scratch on scratch.mit.edu! 🌐 I've got the creative freedom to whip up something awesome—whether it's a game, story, or animation. Here's the lowdown on what I need for this project:

1. **Spriting Fun:** I've gotta use at least two sprites, and to keep it interesting, one of them can't be a cat.

2. **Scripting Magic:** Put together a minimum of three scripts. No need to distribute them evenly among the sprites—just make sure they're doing their thing.

3. **Coding Essentials:** Time to flex those coding muscles. I need at least one conditional, loop, and variable to add that extra oomph to my project.

4. **Custom Block Swagger:** Let's get fancy! Create a custom block using "Make a Block," and it needs to be a team player by taking at least one input.
