CS50x Problem Set 2: Bulbs ðŸŒŸ
=============================

Overview:
-------------------
Welcome to the second problem set challenge in CS50x! In this assignment, I've successfully completed the task of creating a C program named `bulbs` that encodes a given message into binary, using light bulbs as a metaphor. Each character in the message is represented by an 8-bit binary number, resulting in a visual display of on (1) and off (0) states for the light bulbs.

Problem Description:
--------------------
The concept involves encoding a text message into decimal numbers using ASCII encoding, followed by translating those decimals into 8-bit binary representations. The resulting binary instructions are interpreted as on (1) and off (0) states for the light bulbs. The program visually displays each character's binary sequence using a series of bulbs.

Output Example:
-------------------

```bash

$ ./bulbs Message: HI!
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«âš«
âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡
âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡âš«âš«âš«âš«ðŸŸ¡`
```

Enjoy experimenting with different messages and witnessing their binary representations displayed with light bulbs! ðŸŒŸ
