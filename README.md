**Week 0: Learn Scratch** 

In the initial week, you'll explore the basics of computer science, understanding binary representation for numbers, text, and images. Introduction to algorithms and pseudo code will be complemented by hands-on experience with Scratch, a graphical programming language. The first problem set involves creating a Scratch project, offering an enjoyable introduction to programming.


**Week 1: Learn C** 

During the second week, you'll delve into C, a low-level programming language. Core programming fundamentals, including functions, conditionals, boolean expressions, loops, and variables, will be covered. The problem set challenges you to create a program generating a pyramid of hashes, akin to a Super Mario game level's conclusion.


**Week 2: Introduction to Arrays** 

Continuing with C programming, this week covers program compilation, debugging, arrays, characters, strings, and command-line arguments. Lab activities involve writing a Caesar's cipher program, while the problem set presents a scrabble-type challenge, familiar to those who completed the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures certificate on freeCodeCamp.


**Week 3: Introduction to Algorithms** 

The third week focuses on diverse search types (linear and binary), sorting methods (selection and bubble), and recursion. Concepts like big O notation, crucial in computer science, will be explained through additional short videos. The problem sets challenge your understanding of these algorithmic concepts.


**Week 4: Computer Memory** 

Week four explores computer memory, covering pointers, addresses, memory allocation, freeing memory, detecting memory leaks, and explaining stack overflow. Lab and problem set activities involve audio and image file manipulation, showcasing practical applications of memory-related concepts.


**Week 5: Data Structures** 

Concluding the C programming section, week five delves into pointers' usage for storing memory addresses in linked lists. Lab exercises solidify your understanding of pointers, while the problem set introduces the creation of a spell-checking program, providing a challenging yet rewarding exercise.


**Week 6: Learn Python Basics** 

Transitioning from C to Python in week six, you'll work on problem sets translating earlier C programs into Python. Python's user-friendly nature offers a smoother learning experience.


**Week 7: SQL and Relational Databases**

Week seven introduces relational databases and SQL using SQLite. The problem set involves solving a mystery by executing SQL queries, adding an intriguing twist to database exploration.


**Week 8: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** 

Covering internet and web basics in week eight, you'll learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client-side development. The problem set requires creating a personal home page, integrating your knowledge of web technologies.


**Week 9: Flask** 

In week nine, you'll explore Flask, a Python framework for building web applications. Topics include forms, layouts, templating with Jinja, POST and GET requests, and email handling in Flask applications. The challenging problem set involves implementing a full-stack finance application, applying cumulative knowledge from the course.


**Week 10: Wrap-up Lecture**

The final week features a guest lecturer and a wrap-up session with Prof Malan, offering insights and reflections without specific exercises.
