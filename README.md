**Week 0: Learn Scratch**

In this week, foundational concepts of computer science are introduced, covering binary representation for numbers, text, and images. Participants engage in hands-on activities with Scratch, a graphical programming language, creating a Scratch project as their initial foray into programming.

**Week 1: Learn C**

Diving into the second week, participants explore C, a low-level programming language. Core programming fundamentals such as functions, conditionals, boolean expressions, loops, and variables are covered. The problem set involves creating a program that generates a pyramid of hashes, reminiscent of a Super Mario game level's conclusion.

**Week 2: Introduction to Arrays**

Continuing with C programming, this week delves into program compilation, debugging, arrays, characters, strings, and command-line arguments. Lab activities include writing a Caesar's cipher program, while the problem set presents a scrabble-type challenge, familiar to those with prior experience in JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures.

**Week 3: Introduction to Algorithms**

The third week focuses on diverse search types (linear and binary), sorting methods (selection and bubble), and recursion. Concepts like big O notation, crucial in computer science, are explained through additional short videos. Problem sets challenge participants' understanding of these algorithmic concepts.

**Week 4: Computer Memory**

Week four explores computer memory, covering pointers, addresses, memory allocation, freeing memory, detecting memory leaks, and explaining stack overflow. Lab and problem set activities involve audio and image file manipulation, showcasing practical applications of memory-related concepts.

**Week 5: Data Structures**

Concluding the C programming section, week five delves into pointers' usage for storing memory addresses in linked lists. Lab exercises solidify understanding, while the problem set introduces creating a spell-checking program, providing a challenging yet rewarding exercise.

**Week 6: Learn Python Basics**

Transitioning from C to Python in week six, participants work on problem sets translating earlier C programs into Python. Python's user-friendly nature offers a smoother learning experience.

**Week 7: SQL and Relational Databases**

Week seven introduces relational databases and SQL using SQLite. The problem set involves solving a mystery by executing SQL queries, adding an intriguing twist to database exploration.

**Week 8: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

Covering internet and web basics in week eight, participants learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client-side development. The problem set requires creating a personal home page, integrating knowledge of web technologies.

**Week 9: Flask**

In week nine, participants explore Flask, a Python framework for building web applications. Topics include forms, layouts, templating with Jinja, POST and GET requests, and email handling in Flask applications. The challenging problem set involves implementing a full-stack finance application, applying cumulative knowledge from the course.

**Week 10: Wrap-up Lecture**

The final week features a guest lecturer and a wrap-up session with Prof Malan, offering insights and reflections without specific exercises.
